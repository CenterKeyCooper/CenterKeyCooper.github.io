        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <!-- <section id="techbio"></section> -->
        <p>I have been programming since I was in 7th grade (5th grade if you count Scratch). I love creating games but have branched off to more serious technical projects as I have honed my skills. I am now in Turing Scholars Honors Program at the University of Texas.</p>

        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <section>
            <h1> Data Structures(H)</h1>
            <p>My favorite tree is a Trie, but do NOT make a Web Index using a Trie, just use a Map of Maps, the speedup is minimal when it exists at all. Still to say you did it though. Tetris Brain was one of my favorite projects I've worked on for a class, was able to clear 1000s of lines (much better than me) all thanks to genetic algorithms</p>
            <h1> Discrete Math(H)</h1>
            <p>Stars and bars baby. Learned too much about recurrence relations. The Master Theorem always wins.</p>
            <h1>Computer Architecture(H)</h1>
            <p>The highlight of my life was having my Malloc implementation work on the first try. Incredibly cool class, learned a ton (too much?) about ARM, X86, and Verilog, learned a ton (the right amount) of C. Created an interpreter and compiler for an orignial language, malloc, coroutines, and the most intense project I have ever done in my life, pipelining pt.2</p>
            <h1>Operating Systems(H)</h1>
            <p>An incredibly important class, I learned much much more about system and got my hands very dirty. Proud to say that our class's OS successfully ran Doom and our File System (which I worked on) could successfully read and write.</p>
            <h1>Algorithms(H)</h1>
            <p>Even the first week impressed me a ton, I still think Karatsubah Multiplication is one of the most eye-opening algorithms I've learned about. Dr. Price is one of the most impressive people I have spoken to.</p>
            <h1>Concurrency(H)</h1>
            <p></p>
            <h1>Autonomous Driving(H)</h1>
            <p></p>
            <h1>Game Technology</h1>
            <p></p>
            <h1>Graphics(H)</h1>
            <p></p>
            <h1>Software Engineering</h1>
            <p></p>
            <h1>Artificial Intelligence(H)</h1>
            <p>What do you know, linear algebra and probability rear their lovely heads. This does work nicely with the ML class I audited last semester, but now we're also getting pacman to play itself. Eerily similar to autonomous driving believe it or not.</p>
            <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
            <p>One of the likely most practical classes I'll take. It's just a shame that every project costs 5Â¢ an hour! Also keeps me on my java, functional toes and meshed quite well with concurrency.</p>



            <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
            <p>AP Stats++, an excuse to do comically in depth data analysis of the 46-season long Survivor Data set. (Ozzy breaks the physicality score I gave every player because of just how many challenges he won)</p>
            <h1>Mathematical Statistics</h1>
            <p>Used quite heavily in my AI class and the ML class I audited. 100% keeps me on my mathematical toes as a Senior.</p>
            <h1>Linear Algebra</h1>
            <p>Unfortunately this was the most useful math class I took. Annoyingly useful in my Graphics, Game Tech, Autonomous Driving and AI class</p>
            <h1>Multivavriable Calculi</h1>
            <p>I am not sure what the plural for calculus is, but I took these my freshman and sophomore year, good foundations to have especially in applying Math Stats.</p>
            <h1>Data Visualization</h1>
            <p>I do not like R, what I don't like even more is how useful and effective R is! I learned a lot of visualization and data cleaning techniques, how to encapsulate the big picture takeaway from messy, high variable, data sets.</p>
