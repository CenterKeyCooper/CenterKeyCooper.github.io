        <h3>SWE accomplishments this week</h3>
        <p>
            Survivor Texas started filming! Our first shoot was on Thursday and it was incredibly intense. It was sad telling out alternates that everyone else had shown up, but the challenge itself was explosive. Everyone seemed very excited to play and they’re all big characters. We also had a Crew Mafia night which was a lot of fun and are filming our first Tribal Council tonight at 8:00 where the first person will be voted out of Season 3 (I hope it isn’t Octavius). I also am currently finishing up my Graphics project, just have to do Texture Mapping and Cube Mapping now. The most fun part of the week, however, was Valentine’s Day. I thank my team for wrapping up our project on Wednesday evening without me.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of Software Engineering, our team did a great job of finishing our first milestone for our website. I finished the instance pages and made them look nice using Bootstrap. I feel like we also have good infrastructure in place for our next milestone when we set up our actual backend. 
        </p>
        <h3>What was in my way</h3>
        <p>
            I spent a sizable amount of time this week on my Graphics project, which is due on this Tuesday. I also worked around Valentine’s Day and my Girlfriend’s birthday (which was three days after), both of which required a decent amount of setup and planning as well. Also, Survivor Texas starting took up a bit of time, but honestly, all of these were very fun.
        </p>
        <h3>Plans for next week</h3>
        <p>
            Next week, we will set up our backend for our Website and populate our model pages fully with instances. I also plan on finishing the Ray Tracing project for Graphics completely, which will give more more time to work on SWE.
        </p>

        <h3>Paper #5. The Single Responsibility Principle</h3>
        <p>
            The Single Responsibility Principle is something that I was vaguely familiar with but makes much more sense to me after reading this paper. When working on long-term projects, it especially makes sense to adhere to SRP rigorously to keep maintainability high.
        </p>
        <h3>Thoughts on iter() on iterators, equality, indexability, and operators</h3>
        <p>
            Iter() on iterators makes a lot of sense with how the language is designed. Allowing for each loops on any container that is iterable is critical functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Equality also makes sense, is and == should not invoke the exact same behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            Indexability is a concept that exists in most languages. Containers that don’t have that property have iterators to compensate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using operators on objects makes a lot of sense too to integrate home built objects in your program. Also using the Python operators as methods passed in parameters helps a lot with efficiency.
        </p>
        <h3>What made me happy</h3>
        <p>
            Valentine's day was a massive highlight. I am so thankful to my team for finishing the project after my Dinner reservation at 6:00. Also the gifts that I got were so personal and so beautiful, I am beyond thankful.
        </p>
        <h3>Tip-of-the-week</h3>
        <p>
            My tip of the week is to use the Visual Studio Code extension Live Share. It allows for pair programming from two different computers. It basically turns your VS Code project into a collaborative Google Doc and is very helpful given last weeks paper.
