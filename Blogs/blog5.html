        <h3>SWE accomplishments this week</h3>
        <p>I am starting to think that every week is going to feel busy. I spent a lot of time working on Survivor Texas. We did our last 30 casting interviews, had our major production meeting, met our faculty advisor, and decided on the cast and alternates at our final casting meeting. We also now have all of the materials needed for our first week of shooting (thanks Joyce). It wasn’t all work though, we also had our Survivor Texas Soccer, Volleyball, and Dodgeball games as well as our pre-production party.</p>
        <p>In terms of Software Engineering, I got to meet the rest of my team finally and we worked together to decide the theme of our project for the semester, landing on support for Texas Trauma Victims. We got through all of the setup and are now hosting our website. I wrote all of the code for our instances of Therapists, Support Groups, and Trauma Facilities and the CSS to make it look nice.
        </p>
        <h3>What was in my way</h3>
        <p>
            I spent quite a bit of time this week on my Graphics project, which was due on Tuesday. I am also working a lot on the second part of that project to avoid working close to Valentine’s Day. Right now the only thing in my way is being so invested in Survivor Texas to work too much more on any of my projects. This is the busiest time of the year for the club so it makes sense that it would be consuming most of my time.
        </p>
        <h3>Plans for next week</h3>
        <p>
            Next week, we will turn in the first milestone for Software Engineering, hopefully far before the due date, Feb 14th. There is not too much we need to work on further other than resolving the user stories given to us by another group.

        <h3>What made me happy</h3>
        <p>
            This week I continued to keep my girlfriend, I’m getting good at this. Also, our cast is coming together for Season 3, which is very exciting. Everyone that we have talked to seems extremely interesting and enthusiastic about playing on the season.

        <h3>Tip-of-the-week</h3>
        <p>
            My tip of the week is to make the most of hover in CSS. I utilized it this week to make my instance page look a lot more professional without needing to add too much code. This example makes the div look like it is hovering over the page when the user’s mouse hovers over it.

        <pre>
            <code>
            .therapist-instance:hover {
                transform: scale(1.05);
                box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
            }
            </code>
