        <h3>SWE accomplishments this week</h3>
        <p>
            This past week, we had a very fun challenge for the season and our first double shoot. I also spent some time working on Graphics and constructing a new feature on my website to run a few voting algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of Software Engineering, our team finished our team largely took a break after turning in our most recent project. We looked over our code a bit to find areas that make sense to refactor, especially according to our last few papers.      </p>
        <h3>What was in my way</h3>
        <p>
            I spent a lot of time this week on my Graphics project, due on Tuesday, and editing Survivor Texas Season 2 Episode 2, which comes out on Thursday. Also, Survivor Texas starting took up a bit of time, but honestly, all of these were very fun.
        </p>
        <h3>Plans for next week</h3>
        <p>
            Next week, we will get even more started on our final project for this class. I will finish my Graphics project and have a good time with Survivor Texas and the episode I'm editing.        </p>

        <h3>Paper #12. Why extends is evil.</h3>
        <p>
            I did enjoy this paper, it convinced me that it is possible to continue to improve the design of a large scaled program after you have started development, you don't necessarily need every detail hammered out. When working on long-term projects, it makes sense to enforce the modularity of your code by making modules not overly-dependent to any other objects, especially objects that do not immediately relate to them by separating code by interfaces whenever possible.      </p>
         <h3>Thoughts on SQL joins, SQL subqueries and refactoring</h3>
         <p>
            SQL joins facilitate combining data from multiple tables, SQL subqueries allow nesting queries for complex filtering, aggregation, and computation, while refactoring involves restructuring code for improved readability, performance, or maintainability by breaking down complex queries into smaller, more manageable components and optimizing the use of joins and subqueries.
         </p>
         
        <h3>What made me happy</h3>
        <p>
            We finally had our merge for the season, which was a lot of fun, all the players loved their buffs (great work Joyce) and the merge tribal was very interesting and exciting. 
            <h3>Tip-of-the-week</h3>
            <p>
                Learn about containerization technologies like Docker and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes to build, deploy, and manage scalable and portable applications. It is extremely helpful.            </p>
