        <h3>
            How well do you think the course conveyed the class takeaways?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I think the strongest course takeaways were learning to work well in a team on a multi-tool project. We needed to use and document all of our tools very well so that all 5 of our members could understand every aspect of our project.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Were there any other particular takeaways for you?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I think our team ended up learning a lot from other teams in the previous years. If you have resources at your disposal, don't be afraid to use them.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Honestly, working mostly on the front-end, I found our own Postman documentation to be extremely helpful. Having the endpoints and descriptions in one place without needing to dig through our backend code ended up saving a lot of time and helped our final product to be better.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What's the most helpful Web dev tool your group used that was not required?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Adding React Bootstrap to the project helped a lot with keeping the CSS files reasonably long while still making the website looking nice.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did you feel about your group having to self-teach many technologies?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Self-teaching is one of the best ways to actually learn something in my opinion. It was still nice to have a TA to check-in every week with so we weren't completely lost.
        </p>
        <h3>
            In the end, how much did you learn relative to other UT CS classes?
        </h3>
        <p>
            This class felt like it was one of the most aplicable to our careers after college. All of the tools used were realistic.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Class Features
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Pair programming on Hacker Rank
        </h3>
        <p>
            I thought working with a partner was a lot more fun and helped people to not get stuck as easily on the exercises. However, I think there should have been an option to work alone if you chose to.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Cold calling
        </h3>
        <p>
            I actually didn't hate the cold calling, it helped to ensure that I was paying attention every class and I thought the questions were silly and fun.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Rubrics on Gitlab issues
        </h3>
        <p>
            This was an extremely helpful feature, it got our team used to using Gitlab as a way to track progress, which felt like something that we should get used to for real-world jobs.
        </p>
        <h3>
            CATME peer reviews
        </h3>
        <p>
            I thought these were helpful to an extent, but ultimately they felt like bloat at the end of every project. Maybe this is because I never really had issues with my team. I felt like they should be optional.
        </p>
        <h3>
            PechaKucha 
        </h3>
        <p>
            I think this is a very cool idea, but I think it would be a lot more helpful by enforcing some way for the teams to work more together. Almost every one that I've seen so far just seems like a every team member did their slides on their own.
        </p>
       
        <h3>Tip-of-the-week</h3>
