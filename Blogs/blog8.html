        <h3>SWE accomplishments this week</h3>
        <p>
            I am just finished up my Graphics project, just have to do Texture Mapping and Cube Mapping now. The most fun part of the week, however, was Valentineâ€™s Day. I thank my team for wrapping up our project on Wednesday evening without me.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of Software Engineering, our team has just finished our backend and all of our custom API calls. I finished the instance pages and pagination and made them look nice using Bootstrap. I feel like we also have good infrastructure in place for our next milestone when we set up our actual backend. 
        </p>
        <h3>What was in my way</h3>
        <p>
            I spent a lot of time this week on my Graphics presesntation, which was due on Tuesday. I am commiting this from my phone on a roadtrip. Also, Survivor Texas starting took up a bit of time, but honestly, all of these were very fun.
        </p>
        <h3>Plans for next week</h3>
        <p>
            Next week, we will completely finish setting up our backend for our Website and populate our model pages fully with instances. I also plan on finishing the Ray Tracing presentation for Graphics completely, which will give more more time to work on SWE.

        <h3>Paper #8: The Interface Segregation Principle.</h3>
        <p>
            The Interface Segregation Principle is something that I was not familiar with but makes quite a bit more sense to me after reading this paper. When working on long-term projects, it makes sense to enforce the modularity of your code by making modules blind to objects that do not immediately relate to them by separating complex interfaces.      </p>
        <h3>Thoughts on cache, functions, and regex</h3>
        <p>
            Cache were a very clean and efficient way to use decorators to generalize memoization for functions.
         </p>
        <p>
            Functions make a lot of sense in that they define the rules for creating a list, offloading the work for when it is truely needed.
        <p>
            Regex was something I'd seen before, but never properly learned. Taking it step by step makes every expression much more understandable.
        </p>
        <h3>What made me happy</h3>
        <p>
            The biggest highlight of the week for me starting my roadtrip with Joyce. Survivor Texas also remained a lot of fun, I went out with some crew members Thursday night.        </p>
        <h3>Tip-of-the-week</h3>
        <p>
            My tip of the week is to use remove.bg along with favicon.io to create favicons for your website that looks good accross every browser without needing to be a perfect rectangle. That way your browser can display a custom logo that you create for your website instead of the generic React favicon that it probably is right now.
