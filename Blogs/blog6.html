        <h3>SWE accomplishments this week</h3>
        <p>
            We had a Crew Mafia night which was a lot of fun and are filming our first Tribal Council tonight at 8:00 where the first person will be voted out of Season 3 (I hope it isn’t Octavius). I also am currently finishing up my Graphics project, just have to do Texture Mapping and Cube Mapping now. The most fun part of the week, however, was Valentine’s Day. I thank my team for wrapping up our project on Wednesday evening without me.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of Software Engineering, our team assigned all of our roles and started working on populating our backend. I finished the instance pages and made them look nice using Bootstrap. I feel like we also have good infrastructure in place for our next milestone when we set up our actual backend. 
        </p>
        <h3>What was in my way</h3>
        <p>
            I spent a lot of time this week on my Graphics project, which is due on this Tuesday. I also worked around Valentine’s Day and my Girlfriend’s birthday (which was three days after), both of which required a decent amount of setup and planning as well. Also, Survivor Texas starting took up a bit of time, but honestly, all of these were very fun.
        </p>
        <h3>Plans for next week</h3>
        <p>
            Next week, we will finish setting up our backend for our Website and populate our model pages fully with instances. I also plan on finishing the Ray Tracing project for Graphics completely, which will give more more time to work on SWE.
        </p>

        <h3>Paper #6: The Open-Closed Principle.</h3>
        <p>
            The Open-Closed Principle is something that I was loosely familiar with but makes quite a bit more sense to me after reading this paper. When working on long-term projects, it makes sense to enforce the modularity of your code by closing code that is complete.         </p>
        <h3>Thoughts on my_range, yield, and Digits</h3>
        <p>
            My_range was an interesting exercise to do, mostly because it made me appreciate the elegance of the O(1) time complexity of range.        </p>
        <p>
            Yield makes a lot of sense in simplifying code. It reminds me a lot of the functionality of yield in terms of scheduling in Operating Systems.        </p>
        <p>
            Indexability is a concept that exists in most languages. Containers that don’t have that property have iterators to compensate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Digits mostly taught us to appreciate yield. The yield implementation was far more elegant than the generator with return.         </p>
        <h3>What made me happy</h3>
        <p>
            The biggest highlight of the week for me was my one monthaversary. Survivor Texas also remained a lot of fun, I went out with some crew members Thursday night.        </p>
        <h3>Tip-of-the-week</h3>
        <p>
            My tip of the week is to use the Visual Studio Code extension Live Share while actively pair programming with your partners. It works especially well with Docker, knowing that both of you have access to the same enviornment when you stop live sharing.
