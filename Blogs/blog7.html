        <h3>SWE accomplishments this week</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently finishing up my Graphics project, just have to do Texture Mapping and Cube Mapping now. The most fun part of the week, however, was Valentine’s Day. I thank my team for wrapping up our project on Wednesday evening without me.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of Software Engineering, our team has populated our backend and most of our custom API calls. I finished the instance pages and pagination and made them look nice using Bootstrap. I feel like we also have good infrastructure in place for our next milestone when we set up our actual backend. 
        </p>
        <h3>What was in my way</h3>
        <p>
            I spent a lot of time this week on my Graphics presesntation, which is due on this Tuesday. I also worked around Valentine’s Day and my Girlfriend’s birthday (which was three days after), both of which required a decent amount of setup and planning as well. Also, Survivor Texas starting took up a bit of time, but honestly, all of these were very fun.
        </p>
        <h3>Plans for next week</h3>
        <p>
            Next week, we will completely finish setting up our backend for our Website and populate our model pages fully with instances. I also plan on finishing the Ray Tracing project for Graphics completely, which will give more more time to work on SWE.

        <h3>Paper #7: The Liskov Substitution Principle.</h3>
        <p>
            The Liskov Substitution Principle is something that I was not familiar with but makes quite a bit more sense to me after reading this paper. When working on long-term projects, it makes sense to enforce the modularity of your code by making modules blind to objects that do not immediately relate to them.         </p>
        <h3>Thoughts on comprehensions, closures, and decorators</h3>
        <p>
            Comprehensions were a very clean and efficient way to create lists and maps and Python that I hope to use in the future.    
         </p>
        <p>
            Closures make a lot of sense in that they define the rules for creating a list, offloading the work for when it is truely needed.
        <p>
            Decorators were syntax that I had seen before but never fully understood. They make a lot of sense as essentially just function/method/code wrappers.
        </p>
        <h3>What made me happy</h3>
        <p>
            The biggest highlight of the week for me Joyce returning from her Ski trip. Survivor Texas also remained a lot of fun, I went out with some crew members Thursday night.        </p>
        <h3>Tip-of-the-week</h3>
        <p>
            My tip of the week is to use favicon.io to create favicons for your website. That way your browser can display a custom logo that you create for your website instead of the generic React favicon that it probably is right now.
