        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <!-- <section id="techbio"></section> -->
        <p>I have been programming since I was in 7th grade (5th grade if you count Scratch). I love creating games but have branched off to more serious technical projects as I have honed my skills. I am now in Turing Scholars Honors Program at the University of Texas.</p>

        <h2>Classes</h2>
       <section>
            <h1> Data Structures(H)</h1>
            <p>My favorite tree is a Trie, but do NOT make a Web Index using a Trie, just use a Map of Maps, the speedup is minimal when it exists at all. Still to say you did it though. Tetris Brain was one of my favorite projects I've worked on for a class, was able to clear 1000s of lines (much better than me) all thanks to genetic algorithms</p>
            <h1> Discrete Math(H)</h1>
            <p>Stars and bars, baby. Learned too much about recurrence relations and how combinatorics can sneak its way into everything. The Master Theorem always wins, but don’t forget about graph theory—there’s a lot more to those Euler paths than just drawing lines</p>
            <h1>Computer Architecture(H)</h1>
            <p>The highlight of my life was having my Malloc implementation work on the first try. Incredibly cool class, learned a ton (too much?) about ARM, X86, and Verilog, learned a ton (the right amount) of C. Created an interpreter and compiler for an orignial language, malloc, coroutines, and the most intense project I have ever done in my life, pipelining pt.2</p>
            <h1>Operating Systems(H)</h1>
            <p>An incredibly important class, I learned much much more about system and got my hands very dirty. Proud to say that our class's OS successfully ran Doom and our File System (which I worked on) could successfully read and write.</p>
            <h1>Algorithms(H)</h1>
            <p>Even the first week impressed me a ton, I still think Karatsubah Multiplication is one of the most eye-opening algorithms I've learned about. Dr. Price is one of the most impressive people I have spoken to.</p>
            <h1>Concurrency(H)</h1>
            <p>The answer is usually a semaphore, and the Little Book of those is extremely helpful. Every project in this class was in a different language, which was only really cool after the fact</p>
            <h1>Autonomous Driving(H)</h1>
            <p>Those Waymo and Cruise cars you see driving around are a lot more impressive to me now. To be fair though, they have like 30 cameras and sensors and we only had a single lidar, an array of 1024 distances from -145° to 145° so you should give me credit for making simultaneous localization and mapping actually real time (I can't believe CUDA was useful already).
            <h1>Game Technology</h1>
            <p>From collision detection to real-time rendering, this class was like peeking behind the curtain of your favorite video games. We even got to code our own game engine. I’m not saying I made the next Halo, but my networked, multiplayer, procedurally generated, and enviornmentally manipulatable game about penguins exploring an ice cave is a lot of fun!</p>
            <h1>Graphics(H)</h1>
            <p>Learned how to make things look smooth and shiny (Phong shading, anyone?) and how to simulate light bouncing around, in C++ and WebGL. Also the final project for the class was quite fun, minecraft is one of my favorite games of all times. The math was Tough. The payoff was Worth it.</p>
            <h1>Software Engineering</h1>
            <p>This is where all the “agile” buzzwords came into play. User stories, Kanban boards, and actual clients—I got a taste of what it's like to build software that doesn’t just work but works for people. Spoiler: version control is your best friend.</p>
            <h1>Artificial Intelligence(H)</h1>
            <p>What do you know, linear algebra and probability rear their lovely heads. This does work nicely with the ML class I audited last semester, but now we're also getting pacman to play itself. Eerily similar to autonomous driving believe it or not.</p>
            <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
            <p>One of the likely most practical classes I'll take. It's just a shame that every project costs 5¢ an hour! Also keeps me on my java, functional toes and meshed quite well with concurrency.</p>



            <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
            <p>AP Stats++, an excuse to do comically in depth data analysis of the 46-season long Survivor Data set. (Ozzy breaks the physicality score I gave every player because he won every individual challenge except for 1 in S13)</p>
            <h1>Mathematical Statistics</h1>
            <p>Used quite heavily in my AI class and the ML class I audited. 100% keeps me on my mathematical toes as a Senior.</p>
            <h1>Linear Algebra</h1>
            <p>Unfortunately this was the most useful math class I took. Annoyingly useful in my Graphics, Game Tech, Autonomous Driving and AI class</p>
            <h1>Multivavriable Calculi</h1>
            <p>I am not sure what the plural for calculus is, but I took th ese my freshman and sophomore year, good foundations to have especially in applying Math Stats.</p>
            <h1>Data Visualization</h1>
            <p>I do not like R, what I don't like even more is how useful and effective R is! I learned a lot of visualization and data cleaning techniques, how to encapsulate the big picture takeaway from messy, high variable, data sets.</p>
