        <p>This was still one of the most fun things that we've done, even if it wasn't exactly the beautiful scenery that we saw up in seattle. I'd take a cheese platter dinner and a poleless tent with you any night of the week.</p>

        <p>And these are without a doubt the best valentines gifts I have ever been given. Don't ask me to pick a favorite because it is all of them. They are all so personal they make me melt.</p>

        <p>Again, I'm so happy we did this "hike" (swim) together, by far the most memorable hike of my life and completely stunning the whole time. I was talking about you but the views were nice too</p>

        <p>this moment was probably the most magical of the trip, I can't explain it. The snow next to the red tunnles, pulling off on the side of the road, the music playing, it all felt so surreal. Thank you.</p>
