        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <!-- <section id="survivorcontent"></section> -->
        <p>Over covid I watched every season of the CBS Show Survivor. It's a show that I love and when deciding where to go to college, a major factor was whether the school had a Survivor Club or not. Unfortunately, UT was only had a top 10 CS program and was way cheaper than every other option and no Survivor Club. So my Sophomore year I started one myself and it has been the most fun I've had in college.</p>

        <h2>Season 1: Survivor UT</h2>
        <img src="Photos/SurvivorUT/S1 Logo.jpeg" alt="S1 Logo" style="max-width:17%">
        <p>Season 1 started with only myself, Joyce, and Jonathan on the crew. We got a group of 12 students to agree to play on a low-budget rag-tag season and it was a bumpy but well worth it ride. No one on the cast or even crew would have met each other outside of Survivor, all contestants were different majors and we had a wide spread of grades, it was truely a microcosm of UT.</p>
        <h2>Season 2: Wild West</h2>
        <img src="Photos/SurvivorUT/S2Logo.JPG" alt="S2 Logo">
        <p>Season 2 was our first season with a reasonably sized crew, we jumped from starting season 1 with 3 crew members to starting season 2 with 21. We had over 100 total applicants and narrowed it down to 12 for a wild west styled season that saw the Tumbleweeds take on the Dustdevils</p>
        <h2>Season 3: Blossoms and Thorns</h2>
        <img src="Photos/SurvivorUT/S3Logo.jpeg" alt="S3 Logo">
        <p>We have not filmed this season yet though we are very excited, our crew is growing still and we have so many passionate individuals involved</p>
